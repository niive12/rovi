\subsection{Tracking the Points}
The velocity constraint was furthermore limited to only compute the robot movement from the time left over by the vision algorithm.
It is hence assumed that when the time limit $\Delta t$ is exceeded by the vision algorithm, the result of the process is not used.
The time by which $\Delta t$ is reduced, is calculated on runtime and hence dependent on the time it takes to process the specific image.

The slow data set contains 500 points, the medium, 160, and the fast data set contains 50 points.
In order to minimize the effect of outliers, the number of trials is increased on the data sets which have less data points.

The time to find the marker is measured and the mean processing time is shown in table \ref{tb:mean_processing_time}.
The different backgrounds was tested separately to see if it has any impact.
It can be seen that the Corny detector takes more time on backgrounds such as carpet and mosaik window, as they contain a lot of edges and thus a lot of SIFT features.

The minimum $\Delta t$ was found for the different markers on different backgrounds.
The result of such is seen in table \ref{tb:min_dt_lines}, \ref{tb:min_dt_circles}
%, \ref{tb:min_dt_circles_center}
 and \ref{tb:min_dt_corny}.
The marker speeds were only tested for $\Delta t$ being multiples of 50 milliseconds.

In order to measure systems ability to track the point, distance from the ideal position to the position based on the image marker is measured.
In figure \ref{fig:trackingerror_lines}, \ref{fig:trackingerror_circle} and \ref{fig:trackingerror_corny} is the euclidean max error shown for a range of $\Delta t$ in the range where the algorithm goes from not being able to track the marker to being able to.
%\nikolaj{Conclude something: It can be seen that the Circle detector has a larger deviance from the ideal path than the other detectors.}

\end{figure}

Note that the datapoints were sampled with uniform sample steps, but the datapoints where the program generated 'not track-able' are not plotted.

As can be seen on the figures 
%\ref{fig:trackingerror_lines}, 
\ref{fig:trackingerror_circle} 
%and \ref{fig:trackingerror_corny}
, then the tracking error has a high fluctuation and lack of datapoints in the range just before the the sufficient time is reached for which the robot can track the marker.
From the figure the minimum time needed to track the marker reliable can be found.
It is furthermore visible that the point from which the marker can be tracked is approximately the same for all three speeds.
Once this point is reached, the error is approximately constant, but dependent on the marker movement speed.
The breakpoint is around $\Delta t = $ 0.078 [s].

The error when tracking the line was found to be more stable.
As seen in figure \ref{fig:trackingerror_lines}, then there is a sharp change from when it is able to track the marker and when not ($\Delta t = $ 0.035 [s]).
The error for the fast marker speed is first stabilised at a low error after $\Delta t =$ 0.045, whereas the other two are constant throughout.
The final error is generally higher than that of the circle marker, but this is also contributed to by the fact that not the precise center of the marker is found in the vision algorithm.

%The large fluctuation in the maximum error for the Circle algorithm, as seen in figure \ref{fig:trackingerror_circle}, is largely explained by the choice of implementation.
%The default behaviour of the algorithm would only look for circles once in the green channel of the image.
%In worst cases, however, the algorithm finds the hough circles on all three color channels of the image.
%This creates good reasons for the time to variate

\subsection{Tracking the Points}
The three vision algorithms were all implemented into the plugin.
The velocity constraint was furthermore limited to only compute the robot movement from the time left over by the vision algorithm.
It is hence assumed that when the time limit $\Delta t$ is exceeded by the vision algorithm, the result of the process is not used.
The time by which $\Delta t$ is reduced is calculated on runtime and hence dependent on the time it takes to process the specific image.

The lowest $\Delta t$ was then found for the different markers on different backgrounds.
The result of such is seen in table ....

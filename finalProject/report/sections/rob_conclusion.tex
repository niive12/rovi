\subsection{Conclusion}
Visual servoing in RobWorkStudio was implemented for multiple point tracking using the image Jacobian approach.
When tracking multiple points, the image displacement vector was minimized for the mappings using a Dijkstra algorithm.

It was furthermore found that the algorithm works when tracking both one or three points.
The tests where conducted with the three marker movement speeds provided.
In none of the cases it was necessary to constrain the velocity of the robot.
It did, however, come closer to its limits when tracking multiple points.
The tracking error in image coordinates was also found to increase as the speed increases.

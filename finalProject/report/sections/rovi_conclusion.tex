\subsection{Conclusion}
The three vision algorithms were successfully implemented into the plug-in and test were performed to describe their performance.
It was found that the robot was able to track the marker for all datasets when the update time is at least 50, 100 and 400 ms for the line, circle and corny images respectively.

\subsection{Conclusion}
An algorithm was found to locate the three markers in an image.
A set of points was then chosen to represent the position of the marker to be used by the tracking algorithms.



%The markers were found to detect the presence of the individual markers.

%Marker one is detected as the center of the white parts of the image.
%Marker two is detected as the center of the circles of the image.
%Marker three is detected as the corners of the marker.

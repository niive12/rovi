To see how the system performed when the modules have been combined, the three vision algorithms were all implemented into the plugin.
A set of different backgrounds was used to see the robustness of the detectors.
In appendix \ref{app:scenes} can the different backgrounds be seen.

The time it takes to find the marker is measured and subtracted from the time the robot has to move to the point.
This means that the robot will meet the velocity constraints and loose the target if the marker moves too fast.

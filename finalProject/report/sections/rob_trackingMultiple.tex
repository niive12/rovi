\subsection{Tracking Multiple Points}

When tracking multiple points the same procedure as for one point is used.
Here only the image jacobians and $[du, dv]^T$ are stacked to $2 \cdot k \times 6$ and $2 \cdot k \times 1$ matrix, where $k$ is the number of points tracked.

The implementation of the algorithm allows for a vector of points to be used when tracking multiple points.
This is used to specify the set of locations in the image the different points are to be tracked to relative to the center of the image.

\subsection{The First Marker}\label{sec:full_marker1}
The first marker, seen in figure \ref{marker:cross}, contains black crossing lines on a white background.
These are two features which can be used to find the marker so both are tested.

\subsubsection{Using Contours}
The second approach is to use the colors. 
The marker can be described as a big white rectangle, separated by black lines.
If the background contains small white blobs, the marker would be bigger.
If the background is a big white wall, the size of the wall would be larger than the marker so that could be removed based on the size of the object.

The first problem is to select all white in an image.
Converting it to grayscale and selecting high intensity is a way but it does not handle shadows that well and bright areas might be viewed as white.
In figure \ref{fig:threshold_marker1} can the thresholded image be seen and the contours that is detected to be of reasonable size.
The red circle indicates where the marker is found.

A better way to detect the white part is to split the image into the HSV colorspace.
To threshold the image for only the white colors, the HSV values with 
%The value is the intensity of the image and selecting the high values gives the same effect as thresholding the grayscale image.
%To remove intense colored parts, the saturation must be set. 
%A low saturation would mean the image is not saturated with a color.
0-20\% saturation and 50-100\% intensity was chosen.
In figure \ref{fig:hsv_intensity} is the intensity shown in relation to the HSV values.

 \node[left] at (0,0) {Black};
 \draw[dashed] (0,2) ellipse (0.5cm and 0.125cm);

 \draw[thick, ->] (1.8,2) -- ++(0,2) node[midway, above,rotate=90] {Chosen};
 \draw[dashed] (0,0) -- (2,0) (0,4) -- (2,4);
 \end{tikzpicture}

In figure \ref{fig:hsv_marker1} is the white parts and the contours shown for the same area as in figure \ref{fig:threshold_marker1}.
The HSV values are more robust to changes in the environment and is thus better suited for this assignment.

When the white parts of an image has been detected, the blobs can be found.
By calculating the areas within the contours, the parts within the size of the marker can be found.
Once found, the center of the marker is found by taking the most compact contour that is closest to the center of the image.
As the robot will be following the position of the marker, this is a good estimate, but it also proved to be good in the images used in the test set as the distracting blobs were not placed in the center, behind the marker.
Using this approach the marker can be found on all the images in the easy and hard set.
\nikolaj{Should I test how many times the marker is found in images where the marker is not there?
I think it might just always detect the marvin sign or something similar.}

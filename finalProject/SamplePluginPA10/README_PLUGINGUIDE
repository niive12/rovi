Now open the plugin in RobWorkStudio
The plugin is build in /SamplePluginPA10/libs/release/libSamplePlugin.so

The plugin works like the following:

There are two taps, 'ROVI' and 'Settings'.

Settings tap
 - The settings tap enables the specifications of some of the processes.
 - This includes a checkbox on whether the processingtime of an image should be included in the time constraint.
 - A set of line edits in which the name of frames and devices in the wc can be specified (do not change them).
 - A speed setting tab that selects which of the 3 markerspeeds should be used.
 - A cameraview botton to specify if the robots view should be shown
 
Rovi taps
 - A list to chose which marker to load
 - a list to selec the bckgrounds
 - a button 'Process Image' to process the image sequence for the given settings.
 - a slider to pull the robot along the path generated from the above mentions process button
 - a save data buton that saves some information used for plotting
 - two other buttons to generate data for other plots (if pressed these WILL take a LONG time - so you should proabably force close robworks if you hit them)

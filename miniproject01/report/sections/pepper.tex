\subsection{Pepper Noise}
Pepper noise is when a set of pixels on an image are complete black, without the actual photographed scene has these elements.
This is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:hist_pepper}.



\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width = 0.4 \textwidth]{graphics/hist.png}
\caption{Histogram of the original ``Image1.png'' showing pepper noise.}
\label{fig:hist_pepper}
\end{figure}






The first image has a lot of pepper noise.
In figure \ref{fig:hist_pepper} can it be seen that a majority of pixels are completely black.
This type of damage can be undone, using a median filter.

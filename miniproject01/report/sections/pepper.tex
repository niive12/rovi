\subsection{Pepper Noise}\label{image_1}
Pepper noise is when a set of pixels on an image are complete black, without the actual photographed scene has these elements.
To find the noise in an image, an uniform area is selected and analysed.
In figure \ref{fig:hist_pepper_im01} can it be seen that the image suffers from pepper noise.
It is assumed that the proportion of pepper in the uniform area is the same as over the whole of the image.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

A median filter is good to combat salt and pepper noise as it takes the midpoint and thus avoids extreme values.
This assumes that the amount of salt or pepper is less than 20\% and the filter is large enough to get values which are neither entire salt or entire pepper.
To remove pepper noise from an image with mostly pepper noise, the amount of pepper damage needs to be found.
The image was detected to be 60\% pepper.
This means a median filter is not viable as the median is likely to turn out as pepper.

Knowing the amount of pepper means the midpoint can be shifted towards a lighter color.
This method is called alpha trimmed mean.
Alpha mean shifts the midpoint and takes the mean of n middle values rather than picking a single value.
Alpha mean with a mean width of 1 is referred to as a shifted median.
The shifted midpoint, which can be calculated using equation \ref{eq:quantile} and was found to be 80\%. 

\begin{equation}
 q = (\text{pepper}-\text{salt}+1)/2 \label{eq:quantile}
\end{equation}

A 3x3 midpoint filter is applied to the image to remove the majority of the damage to the image.
Then a 7x7 alpha trimmed mean with a width of 3 is applied to further remove the pepper noise.
Running a median filter twice gives the effect of overestimating the damage of the pepper and thus results in a brighter image.

To see if the filters does damage to the original image an area with more complex features are shown.
In figure \ref{fig:complex1_after_alpha} can the area be seen after the alpha trimmed mean filter has been applied.
It can be seen that there is still noise present in the image.

\end{figure}

To see the noise, another histogram of the uniform area is made.
In figure \ref{fig:hist_img1_after_alpha} can the histogram of the uniformed area after the applying two filters be seen.
The histogram suggest that there is still Gaussian noise in the image.
Gaussian noise can be removed by applying a mean filter.
To see which is best for the image, both geometric and harmonic mean is applied to the image.

\end{figure}

In figure \ref{fig:complex1_after_blur} and \ref{fig:complex1_after_harmonic} can the effect of applying a geometric- and harmonic mean filter to the image respectively be seen.
Both filters have the size of 5x5. 
The difference is not that obvious from visual inspection so the difference is calculated using equation \ref{eq:img_diff_harVSgeo}.

\begin{equation}
I_{diff} = \left( I_{har} - I_{geo} \right) * A + 127
\label{eq:img_diff_harVSgeo}
\end{equation}

The difference is shown in figure \ref{fig:complex1_blur_difference}.
The difference is amplified 50 times in order to get a clear contrast between the two.
Darker areas means regular blurring contains higher values.
The most distinct difference between the images is the edges. 
The edges are brighter after the regular filter. 
The most visible edges on the difference image occurs where the image goes from a large area of light to a small area of dark.
Thus the edges are better preserved on the harmonic mean filter.
In the lower right corner, the underside of the gripper is supposed to be dark.
Therefore having higher values with the regular filter gives unwanted bright spots which the harmonic mean filter removes.
It is therefore concluded that the harmonic mean filter is the best for this task.

The resulting sequence is thus:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Shifted midpoint filter, kernel size 3x3, shifted midpoint to 80\%.
 \item Alpha mean filter, kernel size 7x7, shifted midpoint to 80\%, mean width of 3.
 \item Harmonic mean filter, kernel size 5x5.
\end{itemize}
The final image of image 1 can be seen in figure \ref{fig:final_image1}.

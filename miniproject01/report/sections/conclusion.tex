\section{Conclusion}

Image processing can be used to restore an image.
An image with pepper noise was restored using a alpha mean filter.
An image with salt, pepper and Gaussian noise was restored with a median filter and a homomorphic bilatteral filter.
An image with Gaussian noise was restored with a harmonic mean filter.
An image with noise in the frequency domain was restored using a notch filter that took several Butterworth filters and removed the noisy components.
The different methods shown in the report, show that not everything gives a perfect output.
If the noise in the image is identified correctly, it is possible to remove the noise to some degree and get a clearer picture, but not perfect in all cases.

\subsection{Frequency Noise}
In this section image 4.1 is considered.
As the image contains a lot of disturbance in form of lines, a frequency analysis of the image was made.
The magnitude plot of a cutout of the uniform area of image 4.1 is seen in figure \ref{fig:freq_analysis_uni_p4} and the magnitude plot for the whole image in \ref{fig:freq_analysis_p4}.

Figure \ref{fig:freq_analysis_uni_p4} is the frequency analysis of the uniform area of image 4.1.
This should ideally only contain the DC component when no noise is present.
It can therefore be concluded the the bright spots present on figure \ref{fig:freq_analysis_uni_p4}, apart from the DC component, must be caused by the disturbance.
These point pairs are circled on figure \ref{fig:freq_analysis_uni_p4} with each pair their own color.
The two disturbances originate from the lines at an approximate $\pm 45$ degrees angle from the horizon.

These points of disturbance can then be mapped directly onto the magnitude plot of the whole image.
In figure \ref{fig:freq_analysis_p4} the disturbance pairs are marked in the same color as on figure  \ref{fig:freq_analysis_uni_p4}.


In order to remove the disturbances, it was chosen to use a Butterworth filter located at the origin of the disturbances.
The cut-off frequency was chosen by testing a range of values and the best then chosen.

When the filters are applied to the image and the images is turned back into the spacial domain, figure \ref{fig:result_04} is gained.

Furthermore a new magnitude plot can be made, this is shown in figure \ref{fig:result_freq_04}.
It can here be seen that the points were not completely removed by the filter.
This is also visible on the resulting image, figure \ref{fig:result_04}, where the lines are still slightly visible in the borders of the image.
It can also be seen on figure \ref{fig:result_04} that the filtering introduced slight ringing effects around the bottom and outlet of the watering can.

The image was however deemed good enough after the described process and hence not tried improved further.

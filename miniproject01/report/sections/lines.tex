\subsection{Frequency Noise}
In this section image 4.1 is considered.
As the image contains a lot of lines, a frequency analysis of the image was made.
The magnitude plot of this is seen in figure \ref{fig:freq_analysis_p4}.

In figure \ref{fig:freq_analysis_p4}, two pairs of bright spots can be seen were one from the pair is marked by a red circle.
These two pairs originate from the

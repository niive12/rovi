\section{Image Restoration}
This report sets to describe how the four given images from the ROVI lecture are restored to better display the image content.
Each image is separately dealt with in each their own section.

For simplicity, two areas/zones of the images are defined beforehand to display results and analyse sub-areas of the image.
These two parts are called the uniform and the complex area.
% Where complex is a cutout of the fingers of the robot, uniform is a blank surface for which the image should contain only one uniform color and simple is \textbf{WHAT?} .
The complex area is a cutout of the fingers of the robot, showing a more detailed image used to see if the processing destroys the image.
And the uniform area is a cutout where it is suspected that there is a single or a narrow span of colors.
%The simple area is a cutout of a shadow, thus having a visible edge.

\section{Image Restoration}
This report sets to describe the how the four given images from the ROVI lecture are restored to better display the image content.
Each image is separately dealt with in each their section.

For simplicity, three areas/zones of the images are defined beforehand to display results and analyse sub-areas of the image.
These three parts are called uniform, complex and simple area.
Where complex is a cutout of the fingers of the robot, uniform is a blank surface for which the image should contain only one uniform color and simple is \textbf{WHAT?} .

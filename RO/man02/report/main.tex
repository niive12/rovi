\section{Pathplanning using RRT in RobWorks}
For this project, the RRT planner in RobWorks was used.
Here the path was planned from and to the two given configurations $q_{pick}$ and $q_{place}$ in the given scene.
In order to optimize the epsilon of the path planner, this was tested with respect to the time it takes to compute the path and path travelled by the tool frame.

Since the RRT planner is a probabilistic approach to finding a path between the two configurations, then the path was computed 30 times.
The data gathered for the timing of the algorithm can be seen in figure \ref{fig:timeVSepsilon} and the distance travelled by the tool in figure \ref{fig:distVSepsilon}.
To find a solution the path planner must be able to find a path within 15 seconds.
From figure \ref{fig:successfulVSepsilon} it can be seen that a low epsilon decreases the chances of finding a valid path.

\end{figure}

It can be seen on the figures the, passing an epsilon of 0.5, then the likelihood of finding a path within 15 seconds is close to 100\%.
Furthermore the average time is only around two seconds when a epsilon of 0.5 is used.

Considering the path length of the tool, then they all fall between 8 and 10 meters, but with some having a deviation of four meters.

In this scenario an epsilon of 0.8 is advised since it both has a fast computation time and the path length is not deviating too much around its average.
